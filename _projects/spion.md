You can't publish the code but you can explain what protocols where used and how it was made.

If you can share a screenshot of a imgui graph that is supposed to look like a test that would be really cool.

A tcp telemetry tool in C++ using the netcat protocol to update the clients subscribed data from exposed predetermined(server side) variables.

you can talk about the idea behind this.

The initial intent and need that sparked the idea behing develloping this tool.

why the multi client approach? terminal, imgui, qt ... web ?

why did I do the project ?
