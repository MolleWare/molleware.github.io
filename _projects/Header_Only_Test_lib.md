## Description:
This Test Library is intended for non-regression testing. When implementing the test, it should closely resemble writing requirements, and reading it should provide a clear understanding of its functionality.

## Context & Motivation:
This project aims to consolidate all the C++ libraries I develop for personal projects or exploratory purposes. 

To date, I have primarily replicated, to the best of my abilities, a header-only testing library designed for evaluating smaller classes in non-regression testing scenarios. 

This type of testing library was initially created during my time at Pellenc S.A. The ease of use and portability of the original inspired me to develop my own version after leaving the company. My goal was for this new tool to exhibit the same behavior as the original library.

The two primary objectives were to minimize the number of setup steps required in the main test files and to ensure a small footprint for the testing library. 

In summary, the focus was on creating a portable, easy-to-setup testing solution with minimal complexity.

## Technologies:
C++

#### Technical Insights & Growth:

- **Definition of Done**: Good enough" is a significant aspect of effective problem-solving. I explored multiple solutions to this problem, progressively moving closer to an optimal solution. In a professional environment, this iterative approach is often viewed as inefficient. Therefore, to foster growth, it is important to work within various constraints. In my case, developing a tool without time limitations allowed me to become more comfortable with variadic and recursive functions.

## Results:
- I improved my comfortability using variadic and recursive functions.
- The test library behaves in a similar maner than what i have experienced at my last position.
