## About
This type of test library was initialy setup when I was working at pellenc S.A. The ease of use and portability made me want to make my own version afte rhaving left the company. 
My objective was for this tool to have the same behavior as that library.

The two main focuses where minimal setup lines in the main test files and minimal test library footprint. 
In short it needed to be portable and frictionless to setup.

## How
before i publish i neet to verify typename T can not be replaced by a bool.

also need to check the tests return the right number of testes executed.
