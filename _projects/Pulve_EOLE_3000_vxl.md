## Description:
The **Pellenc Eole 3000** is a high-precision vineyard sprayer designed for efficient and accurate chemical application. It features **ultrasound sensors** that automatically adjust the spray ramp to follow terrain and vine height, ensuring optimal coverage and minimizing waste. The sprayer is equipped with an **intuitive control interface** and **anti-drift technology**, making it user-friendly and environmentally responsible. Compatible with both **pneumatic and airblast diffusers**, it adapts to various vineyard layouts and can be mounted on Pellenc’s **Optimum multifunction carrier** for added versatility.

## Technologies:
C++, Qt/Qml, Spion, Oscilloscope, GDB/GDB-Server, Git, VSCode, ssh/shell

## Context and motivation
The **Eole 3000/VXL** was already afunctional tool that had accumulated toomuch technical debt. The cost of changing the code had begun to be to expensive and a technical lead initiated a global refactor of the tool with a new architecture that if respected would idealy limit future technical debt to a smaller part of the code.\
During the initial part of this devellopment I was not attributed to this project. I only participated during the final two years of the four-year development period. The First 2 years consisting in setting-up the ground work for the architecture and having a mostly functional but unstable version of the software.\
The job that was left to me and my team mate was to deliver stable versions that met all the requirements from the product owners. The aim was also to build our non regression tests coverage, build trust with the machine testors and leave a clear, up to date doccumentation.\
At the same time I started working on this project. Most teams shifted to an agil management style.(this detail is probably not usefull??)

## My Role
Where I got into the picture and what was my purpose in this project?

Devellopment of the pulve HD moved the engineers with a poc mentality to it.
making room for me to join the project and prepare the code for production.

#### Key Contributions:
the major decisions I took and the different tasks I participated in while working on that project.

#### Technical Challenges & Creative Solutions:
anecdotes about working on the project // if not full enough you might want to delete this section

## Results:
explain how close to production you got before leaving the company

## Project Timeline:
- **Development Duration**: 2 years
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and actively used by clients

## Key Learnings:
building trust with other teams is key.
documenting changes was the only way to not run in circles around a finished product.

## TO BE REMOVED BEFORE PUBLISHING

In this project page I will talk about all the different things I workde on.

- tank balancing.
- norac integration.
- us sensor

... maybe take the time to remember a few more ? A lot of these where small bug fixes and adding tests+documentation.
