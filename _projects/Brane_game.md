## Description:

This is an Android game developed using the Godot game engine, designed to help improve your working memory. The gameplay involves providing you with a number and then presenting math equations for you to solve while simultaneously memorizing that number. After completing a set number of equations, you are prompted to recall the initially presented number.

The concept is straightforward and step-based, making it easy to understand. Additionally, the settings allow for increasing the size of the number to memorize, enabling players to adjust the difficulty and ensure the game remains challenging yet accessible for all users.

## Context & Motivation:

About 10 years ago I remember playing a game called spiral pulse. It was simple and captivated all of my focus when playing it. It felt like I had mental fatigue after playing it so I thought just like running for cardio I could play that game and improve my focus.\
The Idea behind this game was similar. I wanted to improve my focus and at the same time develop a android game. I had done project apps through school for android projects but most of them where through android studio and I wanted to try something new.

## Technologies:

Godot, GDScript

## Project Timeline:

- **Development Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Status**: actively unused

## Results:

After a few weeks of use of this game I heard of a game called NBack with a similar objective only more effective than the approach I was taking and the game was not blocked behind a paywall so I switched to playing that game instead.
