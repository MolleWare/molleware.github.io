I am an Embedded Systems Software Engineer with a strong foundation in C++ and experience across low-level development, IoT, and robotics-adjacent technologies. My work is driven by a passion for building reliable, efficient systems that solve real problems and positively impact people’s lives. I enjoy diving deep into complex technical challenges—whether that involves debugging kernel-level behavior, architecting embedded applications, or optimizing performance for constrained hardware.

Over the years, I’ve worked with technologies ranging from ESP32/FreeRTOS and Linux kernel modules to Android app development. I thrive in environments where software, hardware, and real-world systems intersect. I also enjoy collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams, testing products hands-on, and turning ideas into practical, high-quality solutions.

What motivates me most is the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects—especially in autonomous systems, drones, IoT, medical systems, and other mission-critical domains where reliability matters. I aim to write software that enables safety, freedom, and better day-to-day experiences for users.

Curiosity, growth, and craftsmanship drive my work. I’m always learning—through new tools, new frameworks, or simply exploring the internals of how systems function—and I bring that mindset to every project I join.
