I am an Embedded Systems Software Engineer with a strong background in C++ development for embedded Linux systems managing complex machinery. My focus is on designing and implementing reliable, tested and documented, efficient systems that address real-world challenges and deliver tangible benefits to users.

Over the years, I have gained experience working with a variety of technologies from web design and Android app development to RTOS on ESP32 boards. I thrive in environments that require collaboration with engineers from different disciplines. Additionally, I appreciate engaging in hands-on testing of products and transforming ideas into practical and reliable solutions.

What motivates me most is the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects—especially in autonomous systems, drones, IoT, medical systems, and other mission-critical domains where reliability matters. I aim to write software that enables safety, freedom, and better day-to-day experiences for users.

Curiosity, growth, and craftsmanship drive my work. I’m always learning through new tools, new frameworks, or simply exploring the internals of how systems function and I bring that mindset to every project I join.
